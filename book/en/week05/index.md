# Week 5 - Transformers

## Learning Objectives:

By the end of this week, students should be able to:

1. Understand the fundamental concepts of the Transformer architecture
2. Explain the attention mechanism and its importance in Transformers
3. Describe how Transformers are applied in various AI domains (NLP, computer vision, multimodal learning)
4. Understand the architecture and key components of BERT
5. Explain the pre-training and fine-tuning process in BERT
6. Discuss the advantages of BERT over previous language models

## Practical Component:

- Implement a simple attention mechanism
- Experiment with a pre-trained BERT model on a basic NLP task

## Additional Resources:

- "Attention Is All You Need" paper by Vaswani et al.
- "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding" paper by Devlin et al.
- Hugging Face Transformers library documentation
